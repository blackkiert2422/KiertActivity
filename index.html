Falling down with the rain
Falling down, falling down
Ah-ah-ah
Ooh-ooh
What color is my sky painted?
What color is your emotion?
Close your eyes slowly and feel the wind
The bonfire is fading out
Maybe we are falling
Falling down with the rain
Falling down, falling down
Ah-ah-ah
Ooh-oohThe branches are small
Burn the sky, clouds become ash
Fireflies becomes a star
What color is my sky painted?
What color is your emotion?
Close your eyes slowly and feel the wind
The bonfire is fading out
Maybe we are falling
Falling down with the rain
Falling down, falling down
Ah-ah-ah
Ooh-ooh
What color is my sky painted?
What color is your emotion?
Close your eyes slowly and feel the wind
The bonfire is fading out
Maybe we are falling
Falling down with the rain
Falling down, falling down
Ah-ah-ah
Ooh-oohThe branches are small
Burn the sky, clouds become ash
Fireflies becomes a star
What color is my sky painted?
What color is your emotion?
Close your eyes slowly and feel the wind
The bonfire is fading out

Falling down with the rain
Falling down, falling down
